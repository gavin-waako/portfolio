These unique garments were sold in her local brick-and-mortar store in Bryanston, attracting a loyal customer base.

She built a reputation for providing unique, stylish pieces that catered to the tastes of Johannesburg’s fashion-forward women. However, the global disruptions caused by the pandemic forced her to close her physical store, and like many businesses, she faced significant challenges. Sales plummeted, and the business was on the brink of collapse. With the world rapidly shifting to online shopping, the client realized the need to pivot and embrace digital platforms to survive. Her new goal was to build a robust online presence that would allow her to continue offering stylish clothing to her customers while expanding her reach beyond Johannesburg. She planned to create an e-commerce platform that would showcase her carefully curated international collections, making them easily accessible to customers who once relied on her physical store for their fashion needs.\"},{\"title\":\"MY APPROACH\",\"desc\":\"To bring the client’s vision to life, our approach focused on creating an intuitive, user-friendly online store that mirrored the quality and style of her previous brick-and-mortar store. We developed a responsive, visually appealing e-commerce site that highlighted the diversity and elegance of her clothing collections. Additionally, we implemented a targeted digital marketing strategy to reach her established customer base while attracting new customers both locally and globally. We also set up a streamlined order fulfillment and delivery system to ensure smooth customer experiences. Recognizing the importance of branding, we revitalized her brand identity to resonate with an online audience, while building strong relationships with customers through personalized service, exclusive offers, and social media engagement. By shifting her business online, the client was not only able to recover from the challenges brought by the pandemic but also positioned herself for future growth in the ever-expanding digital marketplace. Our mission was to empower her to reclaim her place in the fashion industry and build a sustainable, scalable online business that would last long beyond the pandemic’s effects.\"}],\"techStack\":[{\"name\":\"React\",\"color\":\"#00BFFF\"},{\"name\":\"JavaScript\",\"color\":\"#228B22\"},{\"name\":\"Redux\",\"color\":\"#006400\"},{\"name\":\"Node.js\",\"color\":\"#228B22\"},{\"name\":\"MongoDB\",\"color\":\"#006400\"}],\"views\":1240,\"downloads\":320},{\"id\":2,\"title\":\"Oxford Business School\",\"title2\":\"Project Description\",\"img\":\"/img/portfolio/2.gif\",\"imgLarge\":\"/img/portfolio/1.jpg\",\"detailsImg\":\"/img/portfolio/portfolio-details-2.jpg\",\"desc\":\"They are was greater open above shelter lets itself under appear sixth open gathering made upon can't own above midst gathering gathered he one us saying can't divide.\",\"shortDesc\":\"Education Institution\",\"desc1\":\"The goal is there are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.\",\"desc2\":\"There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.
